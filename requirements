OpenLibrary, 
Starwars,

Grab at least 6 items from the API. For example 6 movies from Open Movie Database, 6 Albums from Spotify.


Display these 6+ total items in an attractive gallery
See the api-thumbnail-page.png mockup file. You don't need to use photos if the API doesn't provide them. Clickable item titles work as well. Or you can use regular photos (not photos retrieved from the API) as thumbnails.
